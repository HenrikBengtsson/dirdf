Package: dirdf
==============

Version: 0.0.0-9007 [2018-06-28]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Fields can now be dropped by surrounding them the with tilde symbols, e.g.
   template = "dataset/name.~ext~" and template = "dataset/name.~ext?~".


Version: 0.0.0-9006 [2018-04-26]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add dirdf2() - as dirdf() but where file matching uses dir2() rather than
   dir() so match files by regular expression on the full pathname.

 * Add dir2() - an analogue to base::dir() but where the 'pattern' argument
   matches the full pathname rather than just the basename of the file.
   Moreover, argument 'recursive' can also be an non-negative integer
   specifying the depth of the recursive search, where recursive = 0
   corresponds to recursive = FALSE, and recursive = Inf to recursive = TRUE.


Version: 0.0.0-9004 [2017-05-27]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Add vignette with examples by turning the rOpenSci 2016 unconf HTML slides
   into an Rmarkdown document.


Version: 0.0.0-9002 [2016-04-23]

BUG FIXES:

 * dirdf() did not pass 'template' to dirdf_parse().


Version: 0.0.0-9001 [2016-04-02]

NEW FEATURES:

 * dirdf_parse(), and thereby dirdf(), now support most of the initial
   template features that we decided to tackle at rOpenSci 2016 unconf.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Add help for `dirdf()`, `dirdf_parse()` and on templates.
 

Version: 0.0.0-9000 [2016-04-01]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Add very rudimentary versions of dirdf() and dirdf_parse().

NOTES:

 * This package, dirdf, was created at the rOpenSci 2016 unconference in
   San Francisco, CA, on April 1-2, 2016.
